Create your post in markdown, add the above metadata on the top, and commit it into the _posts folder. Push it to Github and that's it!
Do note that Github has a limit of how many times it will rebuild for a Github Page, if you find your commit/push not reflected,do one of following.
1. Clear your browser cache
2. Wait for the next day when rebuild resumes
